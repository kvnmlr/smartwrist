SmartWrist
======
*Android Companion App for Smartwrist Business Band*
***
The SmartWrist prototype has been developed in a hands-on seminar on wearable computing technologies.
It is worn around the wrist and allows for easy transfer of business contact information when you are at a conference. No need to exchange business cards anymore.

Information is transfered between two bands within 1 second via NFC.

This is an Android app that allows the user to...
* update their personal information on the SmartBand
* retreive contact information of met people from the band and store them on the Android phone.
